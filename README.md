## Why Do We Need This Tool? 🤔

Brakeman is a static analysis tool that helps identify security vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails applications. However, comparing Brakeman reports manually can be tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with large applications or frequent deployments. 

This tool automates the comparison process, ensuring:
- Faster identification of new vulnerabilities introduced after deployment.
- Reduced human error in analyzing differences.
- A clear and concise comparison report for better decision-making.

- **Accuracy**: Eliminates the risk of missing critical changes in the reports.
- **Convenience**: Generates a detailed comparison report that is easy to understand and share.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with your existing workflow, requiring minimal setup.
